Given the patient's history, it is possible that several of the above-mentioned lesions represent prior treated metastases, though it seems likely that some of the lesions probably reflect active metastatic deposits. Comparison with prior examinations may be helpful if these can be made available.

A well circumscribed, space occupying lesion is present centered on the right ambient cistern. The lesion displaces adjacent structures without infiltration or parenchymal edema. The origin of the lesion is not clear, but it could potentially be extra-axial. Internally, the lesion is homogeneous and T2 hyperintense, but also markedly T1 hyperintense with rim susceptibility. This could indicate hemorrhagic products, fatty material, or viscous/proteinaceous material.The differential for this lesion remains broad, but overall, the characteristics are relatively non-aggressive, and as such, a benign etiology is favored. The lesion could represent pure hemorrhage, or a hemorrhagic cyst. Developmental cysts including epidermoid and dermoid should be considered as well. A neoplastic process is not excluded, though the imaging features on the present study are not typical of a teratoma, which would be the most common fetal tumor. Also noted is hypoplasia or absence of the right globe, with dysmorphic/rudimentary orbital structures. Please note that this interpretation is made without the benefit of comparison to ultrasound images. As soon as these images can be obtained, a comparison will be made, and if a change to the interpretation is warranted, an addendum to this report will be issued.

Although the bullet fragment itself does not traverse the inner cortex of the mastoid bone and assessment is limited due to the presence of streak artifact, there appears to be a nondisplaced fracture of the inner cortex of the left mastoid bone and air within or adjacent to the underlying left sigmoid sinus. Partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells may represent hemorrhage and/or cerebrospinal fluid leakage. 2. Left lateral cerebellar convexity subdural hematoma that measures up to approximately 15 mm in thickness, multiple hematomas within the left cerebellar hemisphere with associated vasogenic edema and extension into ventricular system and subarachnoid spaces below the foramen magnum to the level of C2 with compression of the upper spinal cord.

Probable slowly growing mycetoma within a cystic space in the the left upper lobe. Continued imaging surveillance is suggested in 6 months or as per clinical protocol.No substantial change in fibrotic component of UIP pattern, left greater than right. Given the large degree of honeycombing out of proportion to other findings of pulmonary fibrosis, consider collagen vascular disease (especially rheumatoid arthritis) as an underlying cause for pulmonary fibrosis. Esophageal dilation also is suggestive of underlying collagen vascular disease. A substantial minority of patients with collagen vascular disease related interstitial lung disease will not initially demonstrate clinical findings consistent with a defined collagen vascular disease but may manifest these findings at a later date. Consider repeat rheumatological workup as clinically indicated.Increased consolidation within the left upper lobe which may represent aspiration, pneumonia, or organizing pneumonia related to the patient's underlying interstitial lung disease. Increased groundglass abnormality at the right lung base also likely reflects the same process. This can be reevaluated at the time of imaging follow-up.

If of clinical concern, PET scan may be obtained to help prove benignity. Otherwise, three-month CT follow-up recommended. Query history of radiation therapy to this area within the last 6 months.
1.No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Mild age-indeterminate small vessel ischemic changes. If there remains clinical concern for an acute ischemic event, MRI of the brain is recommended.2.Opacification of paranasal sinuses and mastoids as well as right middle ear, with bilateral sphenoid air-fluid levels.

No clear correlating lesions are seen on a recent CT examination from 2/12/2016, nor are any such lesions seen on older MRI examinations from 2015 and 2014. These lesions appear to be confined within the marrow space of the bone and do not significantly encroach upon the sacral nerve roots. One possible explanation is that these lesions represent intraosseous hemorrhage, possibly secondary to bone marrow biopsy or some other mild trauma. Follow-up CT of the pelvis can be considered to reevaluate for osseous integrity. In addition, the patient could return for postcontrast MRI imaging to assess for the possibility, albeit unlikely, of a neoplastic process.2.Bone marrow signal characteristics are diffusely abnormal compatible with patient's diagnosis of myelofibrosis.

Bowel gas pattern unchanged.
1.The appearance of the previously described right level II/III neck mass has changed, becoming more centrally hypoattenuating, approaching fluid density, with internal bubbles of gas. The margins of the lesion are also less well defined and the lesion itself is somewhat expanded relative prior. These changes may reflect necrosis and associated inflammation, though the possibility of mild progressive tumor would also be in the differential diagnosis. The possibility of superinfection should be evaluated in the context of other clinical and laboratory findings.2.Of note, however, there does appear to be a greater degree of compression or invasion of the right internal jugular vein. As such, there may be some degree of venous outflow obstruction and related edema contributing to the above findings.3.Persistent nonspecific pharyngeal and supraglottic mucosal thickening.

Severe hyperinflation of the native left lung consistent with emphysema with stable to slightly increased rightward herniation.

The core of the lesion is largely cystic and necrotic with enhancing tissue seen predominantly along the periphery and the inferior margin. The lesion appears to be quite vascular. The differential diagnosis would include a high-grade primary brain tumor as well as a metastatic lesion. The appearance of the lesion on conventional images would favor a primary brain tumor. However, on spectroscopic assessment, lack of choline elevation in the lesion periphery is a feature often attributed to noninfiltrative lesions such as metastases.
1.Redemonstrated are extensive findings related to prior sinonasal tumor resection. No convincing evidence of locally recurrent disease is seen.2.Lymph nodes in the neck are stable or minimally increased in size from the prior examination.

Improving bilateral pulmonary opacities suggestive of aspiration.
Unremarkable noncontrast brain CT.
Multiple nodular opacities and apparent lung masses are all stable from the prior study, the majority of which are stable going as far back as 11/27/2009.  Left apical poorly defined nonsolid peripheral nodule is the only finding that is increased in size compared to 2009, although this is also stable from the prior study and presence of air bronchograms suggests inflammatory etiology. Continued follow-up is not recommended as these are likely post infectious or post inflammatory in nature.
Bilateral total knee arthroplasties appearing similar to the prior study.

1.Large right frontal lobe hematoma with dissection into the ventricles. Associated mass effect results in midline shift to the left, subfalcine herniation and effacement of the right frontal horn. The right lateral ventricle is mildly dilated.2.Just below and lateral to the center of the hemorrhage, a curvilinear enhancing structure is identified. On T1 precontrast images, there is a suggestion of a tuft or tangle of small vessels. MRA imaging fails to confirm this finding, though this could be a technical artifact. Findings are concerning for the presence of a vascular malformation. Further evaluation with conventional angiography is recommended.3.Several areas of ischemic injury are suspected including within the high left superior frontal gyrus, and within the right basal ganglia. Some of the parenchyma surrounding the right frontal lobe hematoma may also have sustained ischemic injury.
