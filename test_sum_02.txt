105381
1. The bilateral cochlear nerves do not appear well-defined on the DRIVE sequence and may be mildly deficient. However, technical factors may limit the visibility of the structures, since there is suggestion that they are present on sequences with higher slice thicknesses, which are otherwise not optimized for delineation of the cranial nerves. Follow up MRI using a DRIVE sequence with higher matrix size for the internal auditory canals may be useful and this can be performed at no additional charge.2. The brain and brainstem appear unremarkable.

There is likely near complete occlusion of the distal left internal carotid artery just distal to the left posterior communicating artery origin and occlusion of the proximal left middle cerebral artery.  There is opacification of the left middle cerebral artery distal to this. I suspect that this may suggest that the occlusion is not complete.  It is also possible that the occlusion is complete and there is reconstitution of the distal MCA via leptomeningeal collaterals to some degree however I doubt it.  3.	Hyperdense left MCA on the current exam is not on the prior suggests that MCA occlusion may have re-occurred in the interim.4.	The left internal carotid artery is narrowed along the Petrous segment.  The possibility of dissection cannot be excluded on the basis of this exam is certainly could be dissection within the Petrus segment however it could be also reaction to the above entity as well.  If clinically appropriate and a possible MRA of the neck using dissection protocol and may be of benefit.5.	Fusiform dilation (aneurysmal) at the left A1/A2 junction.6.

1.	Revisualization of atherosclerotic/calcific aneurysmal dilatation of the main trunk of basilar artery demonstrate no appreciable interval change in its size, configuration and extent.  Basilar artery superior and inferior to this aneurysm remains patent.2.	There is interval decrease in the atherosclerotic aneurysmal dilatation of the left posterior cerebral artery.  The largest section of this aneurysm projecting in the midline in the basal cistern has decreased in size from 7.4-mm to 4.2-mm on the current exam. There is also decrease in the caliber of left posterior cerebral artery distally from 5.8-mm on prior exam to 4.2 measurement on the current exam.3.	Atherosclerotic aneurysmal dilatation of the pre-cavernous and posterior cavernous portion of left internal carotid artery remains similar to prior study.  A second more anterior focus of atherosclerotic aneurysmal dilatation of the anterior cavernous and proximal supraclinoid portion of the left internal carotid artery.  There is noted a double left posterior communicating artery.  Small left anterior choroidal branch is present.4.	Coiled left vertebral artery at C1 level.  There is however visualization of a very small intracranial left vertebral artery which continues and communicates with the basilar artery.  There is also visualization of a left-sided pica branch.  The filling of intracranial left vertebral is likely secondary to retrograde filling from the right.5.	Nonenhanced head CT demonstrate evidence of interval placement of a right-sided ventricular catheter with the tip in the left frontal horn and with resultant significant interval decrease in the size of supratentorial ventricular system.  There is slightly smaller caliber of the suprasellar component of the aneurysm compared to prior study.  Stable exam otherwise.
105807

Bilateral micronodules measuring up to 4 mm as described above.
105812
No acute abnormalities however the patient does have two areas of residual aneurysmal dilatation of segmental pulmonary artery branches in the right lung which have improved in size and number over the last two scans. This is of unclear etiology and could reflect sequela of prior pulmonary vasculitis or postinfectious mycotic aneurysms. However as signs of pulmonary hypertension are present vascular dilatation from prior thromboembolic disease is also possible. Suggest contrast enhanced PE protocol CT when feasible.
105813
No evidence of fracture. I personally reviewed the Images and/or procedure with the Resident/Fellow and agree with this report.
105814
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.
105815

105816
Line position stable. No change in cardiopulmonary findings.
105817
Midline cerebellar vermian lesion with internal foci of calcification and scattered small foci of enhancement. There has been no significant interval change since prior imaging. Spectroscopic assessment of this lesion shows uniform reduction of all major detectable metabolites. This pattern is non specific but argues against an aggressive, highly proliferative process. The differential diagnosis would include non neoplastic or equivocally neoplastic processes such as dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma (Lhermitte-Duclos disease) or simply a developmental dysplasia of the cerebellum. Uniform reduction of MRS peaks has been reported in Lhermitte-Duclos. Low grade tumors such as ganglioglioma or pilocytic astrocytoma among others may also be considered, but the MRS features are not typical. 
105818
1.No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.2.No evidence of aneurysms or significant steno-occlusive lesions.3.A defect in the left lamina papyracea with herniation of orbital fat may represent the sequela of prior trauma.I personally reviewed the Images and/or procedure with the Resident/Fellow and agree with this report.
105819

No evidence of brachial cleft cyst communicating with the mediastinum.
106139
New wedge-shaped hypodensities in the right frontal and left occipital parietal regions extending from the cortical gray matter to the subcortical white matter with associated local edema.  These lesions could represent thromboembolic phenomena or or manifestation of diffuse anoxic injury given their bihemispheric watershed distribution.  The right frontal hypodensity contains a small linear focus of hyperdensity, which may represent a small focus of hemorrhage.  MRI is more sensitive for the detection of acute and small vessel ischemia, and could be considered for further evaluation if clinically indicated.These findings were discussed with Dr. Leah Witt, 3584, at 4:28 PM

1. Small focal area of cortical diffusion restriction and abnormal signal without definite parenchymal enhancement along the left anterior paracentral lobule. Subtle FLAIR abnormality and diffusion restriction are seen in this area on the prior outside exam. There is at most minimal enhancement within the affected sulcus which is favored to be accentuation of normal vasculature secondary to surrounding edema.Differential diagnosis includes sequela of focal status epilepticus versus evolving distal arterial or cortical venous ischemia or other cortical injury, although perhaps more parenchymal enhancement would be expected in the case of ischemia given the timing of prior imaging findings and symptoms. Encephalitis is perhaps felt to be less likely given the relative mild change in imaging abnormality since prior exam. Underlying lesion such as focal cortical dysplasia or low grade neoplasm is felt to be unlikely. Follow-up MR imaging with and without contrast in 1-2 weeks is recommended, for further characterization.2. Unremarkable MRA head, MRV head, and MRA neck.

107186
Acute sinusitis.
107187
1.Small cyst or perivascular space in the right frontal white matter. No white matter lesions are seen which would be consistent with a demyelinating etiology.2.Evaluation of the spinal cord is compromised by the presence of motion artifact. Inhomogeneity of the spinal cord T2 signal may therefore represent artifact versus true signal abnormality. There may be mild thinning of the left aspect of the cervical cord at some levels as discussed above. If these findings are indeed real, it is possible that a chronic underlying demyelinating process could have produced them, though the diagnostic certainty of this study is low.3.Scattered cervical degenerative findings are seen as above with areas of spinal canal narrowing but no high-grade canal stenosis or obvious cord impingement.

107266
Interval removal of Swan-Ganz catheter. Increasing pleural fluid on the right.
107267
1. A large acute infarct is evident within the right MCA distribution with a moderately sized acute infarct seen in the left MCA distribution. Scattered small ischemic lesions are demonstrated elsewhere throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum. The pattern of disease is largely territorial and therefore a thromboembolic process or possibly in situ cerebral vessel thrombosis would be the favored etiology.2. Correlating with the large right MCA infarct, there is abrupt occlusion of one of the proximal M2 branches of the right MCA. Scattered vascular stenoses are also seen within the left MCA distribution.3. The right vertebral artery is not identified in the neck or intradurally.

107273
Scattered punctate pulmonary nodules, some of which are calcified, are present throughout both lungs.  These are more typical of postinflammatory nodules than metastases though continued CT follow-up is recommended.  The largest noncalcified nodule is in the right lower lobe measuring 5 mm.

107284
Mild hypervolemia.
107285
No change and no evidence of metastatic disease.
107286
Both the kidneys are small for the patient's age. There is increased echogenicity in both kidneys may reflect medical renal disease.

1.	Since the prior examination there is been progression of the patient's tumor mass which encases much of the neck vasculature (great vessels, carotids and jugulars - the right jugular is occluded) and the larynx. The mass is more extensive on the right side than the left side.  The mass extends from the visualized portion of the mediastinum up to the level of the mandible and extends from the left sternocleidomastoid to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and anteriorly it extends from the visceral space and larynx to be pre-vertebral space posteriorly.

As a result many of the lesions identified on postcontrast imaging cannot be adequately evaluated. 2.Since the prior examination the left frontal lobe mass appears to decreased in size. Definitive measurements cannot be made due to lack of contrast enhancement.3. Lesions previously noted in the cerebellum, right temporal lobe, left cingulate gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus cannot be identified on the current exam and cannot be adequately evaluated on the current exam due to lack of contrast enhanced sequence. These particular lesions had FLAIR signal abnormality in the prior exam but currently are not readily identified.

108788
Poorly functioning transplant kidney in the right iliac fossa, most likely secondary to chronic rejection.Normal CT angiography with patent mesenteric vessels.Enhancing pelvic soft tissue structures most prominent on the right side extending into the retroperitoneum most likely represent adenopathy.

1. Motion limited exam. Redemonstration of known left posterior oropharyngeal wall abscess with prevertebral extension from the lower C2 to upper C4 level. Osseous and disc involvement is somewhat difficult to assess due to the extensive artifact from the indwelling spinal instrumentation at these levels, although osseous integrity appears to be preserved on the CT neck exam. Increased STIR signal within the relevant disc spaces may simply be artifactual. Normally, diffusion weighted imaging could be attempted to evaluate for discitis/osteomyelitis, although likely these would not be helpful in this patient secondary to the presence of instrumentation and related artifact. Close follow-up is recommended, as a component of the abscess does extend superiorly towards the anterior margin of the upper C4 vertebral body, and there is extensive left longus coli involvement likely representing myositis.2. Redemonstration of known sinus tract extending to the left anterolateral neck skin surface, not as well delineated as on CT.3.

1. The left ventricle is normal in size and systolic function (LVEF 66%)2. The right ventricle is normal in size and systolic function (RVEF 55%)3.There is a 4 x10 mm, mass that appears on the basal lateral wall just below the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. The mass is likely adherent to the myocardium and appears to extend out onto the basal portion of the MV posterior leaflet. The mass does not appear to be cystic and is not composed of fat. There is no late gadolinium enhancement of the mass and it has vascularity similar to the myocardium, which suggests it is not thrombus. Its location is atypical for vegetation. Mitral annular calcification can present in this way, however there are no clinical predispositions to this (age, ESRD etc). Prior chest imaging (CT or MRI) or prior TTE may be helpful to review if available.

1. The constellation of small posterior fossa with inferior displacement/tethering of its contents, as well as the lumbosacral myelomeningocele, are compatible with Chiari II malformation.2. Abnormal morphology especially involving the posterior part of the lateral ventricles is probably related to medial and inferior displacement by the tethered posterior fossa structures. A partially dysgenetic or partially agenetic corpus callosum could also be contributing to this appearance. 3. Due to technical limitations, some of the more subtle features of Chiari II may not be detected on this exam. However, the ventricles are not dilated, and the brain otherwise shows a relatively normal volume and normal gyration.
110691

Left superior parietal lobule and the left superior internal parietal branch territory involvement involvement may be more recent. Although it is possible that all these infarcts are related to right ICA territorial thromboembolic event if one considers that the left superior parietal lobule was supplied via pial collaterals from the left superior internal parietal artery and the left superior internal parietal artery occlusion resulted in infarction of both territories, however, punctate foci of diffusion restriction on the recent MRI located in the left occipital lobe indicate left posterior cerebral artery supply from the vertebrobasilar circulation and therefore would have a different source.4.There is no evidence for hemorrhagic conversion.5.Encephalomalacia along the left inferior parietal lobule

1.There are 2 punctate foci of hyperintensity within right frontal subcortical white matter, associated with T2 hyperintensity. This appearance, in this location, can be seen as a residual finding from diffuse axial injury. Given the lack of other parenchymal susceptibility findings, other etiologies in the differential diagnosis such as multiple cavernous malformations, chronic hypertensive microhemorrhage, and amyloid, are felt to be less likely. Given the lack of history of primary tumor, hemorrhagic metastasis is felt to be unlikely. 2.A third focus of susceptibility along the left lateral ventricular wall laterally likely represents hemosiderin from prior ventricular hemorrhage.3.There is diffuse volume loss without a specific lobar predominant atrophy pattern.4.Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.5.Incidental note is made of diffuse calvarial thickening, with a homogeneous marrow pattern, which is most often a normal anatomic variation. If there is a past history of seizure medication use, or of sickle cell disease, these can result in diffuse calvarial thickening.

Nonspecific scattered foci of low attenuation within the white matter of both hemispheres as described above, which could represent small vessel ischemic disease of indeterminate age but also a demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis.  The extent and circumscribed appearance of these lesions in the absence of any history of prior symptoms suggests that a demyelinating process is more likely.  Multiple metastatic lesions are also a consideration, but this is less likely given the absence of an appearance of edema or mass effect.

Cardiomegaly and mild basilar edema.
115106
Since the prior pretreatment examinations, the overall size of the patient's left frontotemporal tumor has increased. While this at least partly represents development of central necrosis, which could reflect response to treatment, areas of progressively thicker rim enhancement are also seen. There is also a generalized increase in mass effect with progressive midline shift to the right and developing entrapment of the right lateral ventricle. Overall, the findings are concerning for progressive tumor with perhaps a minor component of treatment effect.

Previously questioned ventral epidural fluid collection at the L1-2 level is not clearly identified on this dedicated exam. Instead there is mild dorsal epidural soft tissue thickening at L1-2 and L2-3 with mild enhancement. This may represent mild inflammation adjacent degenerated facets, less likely a manifestation of infection.3. Nonspecific 12 mm fluid collection in the right paraspinal soft tissues at the L4-5 level of uncertain significance.4. Multilevel degenerative changes with associated neural foraminal narrowing at L4-5 and L5-S1.I personally reviewed the Images and/or procedure with the Resident/Fellow and agree with this report.

Direct inspection of this area is suggested.
118394
1.	Significant area of vasogenic edema in the left anteroinferior frontal lobe with mass-effect, effacement of the left lateral ventricle, and midline shift of approximately 6 mm.2.	Small focus of hemorrhage in the anterior left frontal lobe.3.	These findings are highly suspicious for possible underlying mass lesion and should be further evaluated with enhanced MR imaging.

118395
1. Postoperative findings related to left maxillectomy, with diffuse confluent soft tissue thickening along the lateral aspects of the surgical bed, particularly in the left retromolar trigone region, where this appears to be more mass-like, as well as irregularity of the anterior alvelous, which may represent recurrent tumor.

118432
The uterus is significantly enlarged, measuring up to 18 cm in sagittal dimension. This may be secondary to a large endometrial mass which is significantly dilating the endometrial canal to upwards of 10 cm, and thinning the remaining myometrium and uterus around it. This dilated endometrial canal contains heterogenous nodular/frond-like enhancing tissue. Alternatively, on certain sagittal images it appears that this may be a uterine mass with a possible capsule (best seen near the cervix) with internal heterogenous enhancement (sagittal image 53), and the endometrium is not visualized because it is compressed anteriorly. If the former is true, there does not appear to be definitive extrauterine extension, but there is likely myometrial extension near the fundus (sagittal image 72). Additionally, there are prominent gonadal collateral vessels on the left (7:84). Regarding etiologies, if the former is true, this is suspicious for endometrial cancer, and if the latter is true, given a history of prior fibroids per ordering physician, this could be a leiomyosarcoma, but definite tissue diagnosis is suggested.Hepatic hemangiomas.Two pulmonary nodules as above.

Redemonstrated is a large, predominantly cystic lesion occupying multiple right neck spaces. The rim and internal septations of the lesion demonstrate thin enhancement.A relatively more solid lesion with heterogeneous internal fat and fairly homogeneous enhancement is seen at midline in the nasopharynx, just posterior to or within the cleft palate. This lesion abuts the cystic lesion and may be part of it, or may represent a second lesion.The predominantly cystic and widely infiltrative, transspatial characteristics of the lesion support the possibility of a lymphatic malformation. The solid enhancing nasopharyngeal lesion could represent a venous malformation rendering the overall lesion a combined veno-lymphatic malformation, or it could represent a separate, possibly vascular lesion such as a hemangioma. The possibility that the combined cystic and solid lesions represent a teratoma should also be considered but this is felt to be less likely.The lesion encroaches into the right middle cranial fossa, but there is no significant mass effect upon the brain and no evidence of brain parenchymal invasion. Otherwise, assessment of the brain is within normal limits for gestational age.
