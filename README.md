This is our repo for the hackday project (drowsiness+distraction detection)

ideas:
maybe add Rasberry Pi (slow with dlib)
do facial detection for drowsiness if the head is facing ahead, otherwise do distraction detection
redesign GUI, make it different and unique


work:
06/06:
work out the setup, look at code, understand output of facial detector, try adding head pose detection (look at ratio change with respect to initial average)
